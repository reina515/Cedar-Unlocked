You can start using the app in two ways:

### 1. Run in Android Studio (recommended)
The app is fully compatible with Android Studio. Open the project and run it on an emulator or a physical device.

- [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

### 2. Run with Expo
If you want to quickly preview the app without building a full Android project, you can use Expo:

\```bash
npm install
npm start
\```

Then, scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your Android device to run the app.

- [Download Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)

You can start by entering trip details (region, dates, traveler type, budget) or exploring the public transport guide for routes, schedules, and fares.
