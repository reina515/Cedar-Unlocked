Please follow these steps to set up and run the app successfully:

---

## Step 1: Install Android Studio (recommended)
The app is fully compatible with Android Studio. You will need it to run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.  
Download and install Android Studio from [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).  
Open the CedarsUnlocked project in Android Studio and run it on an emulator or a connected Android device.

---

## Step 2: Install Node.js and npm
Expo requires Node.js and npm to manage packages.  
Download and install Node.js (includes npm) from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).  
Verify installation by running in your terminal: `node -v` and `npm -v`.

---

## Step 3: Install Expo CLI
Install Expo CLI globally using npm: `npm install -g expo-cli`.  
Verify installation by running `expo --version`.  
Expo allows you to quickly run the app without a full Android build.

---

## Step 4: Install the Expo Go app on your Android device
Download Expo Go from [https://expo.dev/client](https://expo.dev/client).  
Open the app on your device to scan the QR code from Expo and preview the app.

---

## Step 5: Install Project Dependencies
Open a terminal in the CedarsUnlocked project folder and run `npm install` to install all required packages.

---

## Step 6: Start the App with Expo
Run `npm start` in the terminal to start the development server.  
Scan the QR code displayed using the Expo Go app on your Android device.  
The app should now load and be fully functional.
